Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) data is difficult to come by. It is also becoming critical for effective investment analysis.
It helps you assess the risks – and opportunities – posed by companies’ performance in critical areas such as climate change, executive remuneration, and diversity and inclusion. 
But a definite lack of transparency and standardization in such reporting presents major challenges for investors.

This small project attempts to lay a framework to allow analysis and gather insight into countries' ESG metrics at granular and macro-levels.
